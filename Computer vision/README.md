# Computer Vision Project

This project focuses on computer vision tasks with tools for managing files and models for image classification and object detection.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```bash
Computer Vision/
│
├── FileManagement/
│   └── (Tools for file management and handling)
│
├── Models/
│   ├── Classification/
│   │   └── (Files and scripts related to image classification models)
│   └── Detection/
│       └── (Files and scripts related to object detection models)
│
└── README.md
```


### 1. **FileManagement Folder**
   This folder contains utilities and tools that assist in file management and processing tasks. These tools help to streamline operations like organizing datasets, pre-processing images, and managing output results.

### 2. **Models Folder**
   This folder contains all models related to image classification and object detection. It has two main subfolders:

   - **Classification:**
     This subfolder contains models, scripts, and configurations related to image classification tasks. These models are used to categorize images into predefined classes.
   
   - **Detection:**
     This subfolder holds models, scripts, and configurations for object detection tasks. These models are used to detect and localize objects within images.
