### 1. **FileManagement Folder**
   This folder contains utilities and tools that assist in file management and processing tasks. These tools help to streamline operations like organizing datasets, pre-processing images, and managing output results.

### 2. **Models Folder**
   This folder contains all models related to image classification and object detection. It has two main subfolders:

   - **Classification:**
     This subfolder contains models, scripts, and configurations related to image classification tasks. These models are used to categorize images into predefined classes.
   
   - **Detection:**
     This subfolder holds models, scripts, and configurations for object detection tasks. These models are used to detect and localize objects within images.
